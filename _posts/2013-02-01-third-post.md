Almost daily an interesting project appears on GitHub and you want to keep
track of it because you know, sooner or later you will have to get ride of a
similar problem in your own work.

Then you hit the watch button and in a blink of eyes, your "Watched
Repositories" list, grows to the point it will be very difficult looking for
something when you will have to ( my own list count 1641 repos, today ).

That's the way Â GitWatcher has been thought, sync and watch your github watch-list 
is just a matter of "[sign in](http://gitwatcher.com/auth/github)", if
you already have a GitHub account, infact, it utilize GitHub as authentication
system provider.
